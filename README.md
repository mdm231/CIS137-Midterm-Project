This app, Sports Cards, is a list of a few cards I own, with the current prices. The price is very dependent on the quality, aka grade of the card.
PSA is a company that grades cards, 10 is the highest grade which is "mint." If you click on a player on the home scree, you will be taken to another screen 
which shows a larger picture of the card, as well as the price and a description. I made a short video, in .MP4 format, and stored it on Dropbox.
Here is a link to the video:
